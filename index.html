            <h2>What Is Hospice Care?
</h2>
            <p>Hospice care is a form of specialized medical care focused on comfort and quality of life for people with terminal illnesses. Rather than aiming to cure, <a href="http://dnkhealth.com/health-consulting-services/"style="color: aqua;">hospice care</a> manages pain and symptoms while addressing emotional, spiritual, and psychosocial needs.</p>
            
            <p>Hospice is appropriate when a patient has a prognosis of six months or less to live if the illness follows its expected course. The goal is not to extend life unnaturally, but to make the final chapter as peaceful and meaningful as possible.
